# Atlas planner

Open **Atlas** beside **AI builds**, or switch to **Atlas** in the full-width planning workspace. **< Build** returns to your previous build tab.

1. Choose the exact tree version. We bundle official **3.27.0, 3.29.1, 3.29.3 and 3.30.0-preview** graphs. New plans for 3.30 characters default to the 3.30 preview; older characters use the stable graph. The 3.30 preview has **150 base points**; its Standard and Covens graphs are identical in the pinned publication. Ruthless Atlas graphs are not included.
2. Enter a name and the number of Atlas points you have earned. The initial budget is the tree's maximum; it does not read account progression. On older trees, you must have enough earned points to reach Unwavering Vision before its granted points can be used. Plans that cannot reach it are flagged; some need a temporary path and refunds, which the planner marks for review rather than proving a transition. Previously saved plans remain readable.
3. Filter a mechanic directly in the inspector, or search names and stat text. Matching nodes highlight and preview a result without moving the camera. Choose a result or press **Go** to center it. Result labels show added point costs. Use **Connect +N** to add the previewed shortest connection.
4. Use the mouse wheel to zoom and drag empty space to pan. **Fit tree** resets the view. The canvas uses the official background, node icons, frames and mechanic emblems. Allocated paths are gold; avoided nodes have red frames. Hover for modifier descriptions. Double click a node to connect it, or remove it if allocated.
5. **Avoid selected** excludes a node from future paths. Desired and avoided preferences are saved with the plan and portable JSON. **Remove branch** also removes disconnected allocations. **Undo** and **Redo** restore allocations and preferences. Press Enter after editing a budget to include it in history.
6. Open **Notes & sharing** for farming notes and import/export. Choose **Keep plan** to keep the draft in this build. This changes unsaved metadata. Use the normal build **Save** to persist it. Saved plans have a total metadata size guard, with no eight-plan count limit; **Saved plans** opens or deletes them.

**Find nodes** opens a searchable list with mechanic filters and added point costs. Choosing a result highlights its mechanic on the tree. The minimap moves the camera without changing allocations. Drag the divider beside the inspector to resize it.

**Targets** collects desired nodes; Shift-click marks them directly on the tree. Toggle a mechanic's notables together, then preview a route retaining existing allocations or rebuilding from the start. Recalculation runs in short background slices, with pause/cancel controls. Review added/refunded points, connected targets and keystone effects, then **Use preview**. Changed plans require recalculation. The optimizer compares a bounded set of target orders; it does not claim a global optimum.

**Routes** compares the shortest connection with available alternatives. In **Plan tools**, mark a selected node as a preferred waypoint, open editable mechanic starting routes, compare the draft with a saved plan, or restore an earlier history state. Starting routes compare target orders and connect up to three nearby notables from the bundled graph; they do not predict farming income. Route comparisons honor the current budget and exclusions.

**Allocated stats** opens an investment overview, mechanic counts, keystone tradeoffs and searchable raw bonuses. Saved-plan comparison can overlay added paths in green and removed paths in red. Counts are not effective map odds: increased effect, conditions and keystone interactions are not simulated. Atlas allocations do not change character DPS or EHP.

## Sharing

**Copy plan** exports JSON with the exact patch version, point budget, allocations and notes. **Paste plan** imports that JSON into the current draft. Review it before keeping it.

**Official link** copies a version-six `pathofexile.com/fullscreen-atlas-skill-tree/` URL. These URLs do not contain a patch version. For an official URL import, first select its original patch and budget, then use **Paste plan**. The importer rejects unknown, disconnected and over-budget nodes. Node IDs can survive between patches while changing meaning, so a successful import is not proof that the selected patch is correct. Use our JSON format for reliable versioned sharing.

Other planners' proprietary links, old URL formats and shortened links are not imported. Export an official Atlas URL from that planner first. The official website may display a different patch from an older saved plan.

## AI tools

Reconnect the MCP client after updating. Enable build proposals in **AI builds**.

- `get_atlas_plans`: read saved plans, bundled versions and the build revision.
- `search_atlas_nodes`: search a selected official graph for native node IDs and text.
- `plan_atlas_tree`: connect up to thirty desired IDs to a plan, optionally avoiding nodes. Returns a separate draft, added nodes, point accounting, stat text and an official link.
- `propose_atlas_plan`: submit that plan for normal desktop review. Only the desktop **Apply** button commits the candidate; build **Save** persists it.

Search and routing are queued. Poll `get_proposal_status` and match the returned request ID. Neither tool applies changes. Routing uses deterministic shortest connections in target order. Set `optimize: true` to compare the original, reversed, cyclic and nearest-target orders, retaining the valid result with the fewest additional allocations. Starting routes use this comparison automatically. Existing allocations and exclusions stay intact; the final tree must fit the supplied budget. The response includes the number of orders checked and savings against the original order when that order was valid. This bounded search is a heuristic, not a globally optimal multi-target solver. Gateways use the official graph links. Granted Atlas points are counted in the final budget.

Example request: “Use my Atlas version and a 90-point budget. Find Essence and map-sustain nodes, avoid mechanics I dislike, and propose a connected farming plan. Explain the keystones and tradeoffs before I apply it.”

The planner does not fetch character Atlas completion, scrape community trees, provide popularity heatmaps, price supplies or predict farming income. **Stages & strategy** records progression, respec routes, maps, supplies, requirements and dated setup estimates; see [connected planning tools](planning-workflows.md).

## Sources and maintenance

Node names, stats, links, positions, point limits, granted points and artwork come from [GGG's official Atlas export](https://github.com/grindinggear/atlastree-export). Each bundled graph records its immutable source URL, commit and SHA-256. Decorative mastery icons are excluded from allocation. Artwork is bundled from the same pinned official export; planning works offline. No third-party planner code or artwork is bundled.

`python tools/update_atlas_data.py` regenerates the graphs from pinned official exports. Updating versions also requires changing the native and MCP version allowlists, testing changed rules and budgets, and publishing the new files in the updater manifest. There is no silent network update of saved plans.

Use `--version 3.30.0-preview` to regenerate only that pinned preview. Its provenance includes checksums for both Standard and Covens exports and verifies that their graph data is identical. Existing plans retain their original version; changing versions starts an empty draft rather than reinterpreting old node IDs.

Feature research: [Path of Pathing](https://pathofpathing.com/) offers desired/avoided-node routing and exports; [poe.ninja](https://poe.ninja/posts/atlas-trees) offers community-tree filters, heatmaps and stat breakdowns. Our planner provides local versioned planning and AI review; those broader discovery tools remain useful alongside it.
