# Crafting coverage and rules

The independent engine uses PoB modifiers and an immutable [RePoE export](https://github.com/repoe-fork/repoe-fork.github.io/tree/ae6d85a5c36857e08819852ab8732239294aba59), version **3.29.3.6**. It incorporates several announced 3.30 rules, including experimental partial locks and the [published base implicit changes](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/4013680). Existing explicit implicit lines are retained; a Blessed Orb updates a recognized legacy implicit where the patch notes permit it. On those changed bases, an unrecognized ordinary implicit is rejected instead of guessed. The legacy Artillery Quiver implicit remains separate. Other 3.30 crafting changes and modifier data are not yet incorporated; it does not yet provide complete Craft of Exile parity.

| Area | Included | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core | Ordinary currencies, bench IDs, multiple crafted modifiers, crafted-mod removal, essences, one/three-mod bench rerolls | Resolvable non-unique items. Essences/resonators reject meta modifiers. |
| 3.30 partial locks | One/two prefix or suffix locks; core Alteration, Chaos, Annulment, Scouring, Divine, Exalted and bench actions, including one/three-mod rerolls; Harvest reforge/augment; independent socket, quality, implicit and enchantment crafts | Experimental: assumes uniform selection among all original modifiers on the protected side (including fractures) and shared groups with full locks. Bench rerolls select protection once for the action; options require a possible removal sequence, but other selections or later rolls can fail. Harvest augment selects protection before adding its modifier. Other interactions are rejected while a partial lock is present. |
| Import | Known native identities and uniquely resolvable plain copies, including multi-line flasks, tinctures and cluster tags | Explicit item level required. Ambiguous identities and values that cannot be reconstructed are rejected; no hidden tier or roll is guessed. |
| Cluster jewels | The [3.30 shared family](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/4013680) prevents new combinations of small-passive Attack Speed and Cast Speed modifiers. | All 36 members match the `AfflictionJewelAttackOrCastSpeed` group in a local export of client 3.30.0.1.4, including conditional and minion variants. Known legacy combinations can be retained when imported with recognized modifier identities. Existing values are not silently removed. |
| Abyss jewels | The crafting model applies 446 client-verified 3.30 weight changes, including the Assembled Eye's shared pool. Seven older natural modifiers no longer roll but existing copies remain importable. | Other modifier data remains pinned to 3.29.3.6. The new unveiled-jewel pool is not yet modelled. |
| Fossils | Combinations, tag weights, special added/forced mods, lucky rolls, fractures, corrupted implicits | Tangled needs a revealed outcome; Sanctified uses empirical level bias. |
| Harvest | Tagged reforge, augment/remove, ordinary equipment, shield maximum, Abyss jewel and regular/maximum jewel resistance swaps, 14 quality enchantments with client-derived eligibility and costs | Reforges include minion, elemental, attribute, mana and drop tags with their Crystallised Rancour costs; those tags do not have augment recipes. Arbitrary legacy crafts and hybrid resistance swaps are excluded. Resistance swaps reroll values within the replacement tier using the model's roll distribution. Each 3.30 swap consumes 300 Lifeforce for each element: Wild for fire, Primal for cold and Vivid for lightning. |

| Influence | Six slams, Awakener, Dominance | Known native higher tiers and compatible bases. |
| Veiled | Remove/add veil, offered choices, preferred choices in recipes | Pending choices are unfinished items. |
| Bestiary | Level 20/30 Aspects, affix conversion, magic and rare Talisman imprints, restore, random metamod, influenced augmentation, one/two-mod Talisman fractures | Imprints cannot be restored onto fractured items. Talisman fractures sample distinct modifiers uniformly. Rare Talisman imprint uses a user-supplied whole-action price. Unique services remain unsupported. |
| Eldritch | Ember/Ichor, Conflict through tier 6, dominant-side currencies | Ambiguous imported tiers require structured input. |
| Properties | Blessed, Sacred, quality, catalysts, tainted quality/catalysts | Some multi-stat precision remains approximate. |
| Sockets | Bench count/links, 3.30 white-socket bench, Bestiary maximum links, Omens of Connections and Trichromatism, Binding, Chromatics, non-white bench, tainted socket currencies | Binding is [no longer generated in 3.30](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/4013680); existing orbs still work and [ignore the natural item-level socket limit](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Orb_of_Binding), subject to the base limit. Bestiary maximum links covers uncorrupted non-unique equipment and existing ordinary sockets. Ordinary random Jeweller/Fusing and Abyssal socket crafting are incomplete. Tainted Fusing uses assumed tie and direction rules for choosing a linked group. Link targets do not count Abyss sockets, and unsupported socket crafts are disabled. |
| Corruption | Equipment Vaal and Locus branches, paired implicits, terminal destruction, tainted Exalted/Chaos | Brick socket/link rerolls, jewels/flasks and unique transformations are incomplete. Locus excludes special transformation bases, fractures, synthesis and meta modifiers. |
| Memory | Remembrance observations, tier filtering, consumption, Unravelling, Foulborn Augmentation/Regal/Exalted | Empirical models. Some consumption ceilings and behavior without strands are inferred. Counts are retained in structured state. |
| Recombination | Either base, chosen-base item level, conflicts, exclusivity, fracture host, base eligibility, continued crafting; predictable selections calibrated to an observed success percentage | Experimental models. The older count table does not reflect 3.30 changes for pools of one to three modifiers. Exclusive-only side ordering is rejected. Hidden weights, some non-rollable families and automatic predictable odds remain unresolved. |
| Ducats | Cyaxan, Genteel, Brinehook, Merrick, Rotmother, Kishara, Tzamoto | Katakohi and Ukatoa remain incomplete. Tzamoto uses an assumed 50/50 reset/destruction branch. Rotmother's native pool is generated from the pinned game export; some new modifier effects still have native calculation warnings. |
| Allflame | Historical 3.29 client-derived profiles, ship upgrades, class/level-scaled Sulphur costs, independent ghost previews, Intangibility collapse, preferred-target selection, conditional finite-outcome calculation | Not core in 3.30. Gain intervals are sampled uniformly; collapse and selection remain model assumptions. An observed override is available. Existing imprints are consumed. |
| Planning | Rich targets including native weapon/defence minimums, linked socket-colour counts and specific fractures/crafted flags, manual starting-item edits, bounded routes/loops, background jobs, cancellation, starting-item costs, percentiles, final-affix/property distributions, retained successes, finite-outcome enumeration with cancellable sampled fallback, fossil comparison | No globally cheapest policy guarantee. |

Socket craft inspection includes the modelled colour bench, Chromatic and tainted currency actions alongside the deterministic socket and link services. Omen of the Jeweller plus a Jeweller's Orb adds white sockets up to the base and item-level limit, retaining existing colours and links. Random outcomes remain labelled as such, and unavailable choices explain their current restrictions.

Cluster-jewel small-passive resistance conversions use the matching size and tier. Resistance conversion is refused when another eligible, unprotected family is not yet modeled, even if a supported modifier could be converted. This avoids presenting a definite outcome when the game could choose the unsupported modifier.

## Saved resource prices

Each gear project can store a price book with a common unit, source, quote time
and resource values. The native **Resource prices** editor uses bundled currency
art and can copy quotes from another gear project. It does not fetch live prices
or convert currencies. Clear quotes before changing their unit. Changing the
unit also clears action overrides and the starting-item cost.
If you entered a rare Talisman imprint service quote in preview 100, re-enter
it as a service price; a Bestiary Orb quote does not price the craft.

Simulations, recipe comparisons and fossil optimization share these quotes,
including through MCP's `priceBook` option. Explicit `prices` entries override
the corresponding shared resource. `actionPrices` instead prices only its
matching action key; it does not change another step's ingredient quotes. Zero is free and missing is unknown. Bench services and other actions
without verified ingredient quantities remain whole-action quotes. Quote dates
are preserved when editing or copying unless explicitly changed.

Bench ingredient quantities come from the pinned export. Native effects match
by complete displayed ranges, tier, affix type and item class, including Rune
Daggers and Warstaves. Conflicting costs and unmatched effects remain unknown;
row numbers alone never identify a service. An explicit whole-action override
still takes precedence. MCP inspection includes ingredients, source modifier
IDs and whether a verified ingredient cost is available.

Crafted-mod removal and the supported one/three-modifier bench reforges use
client-exported service costs by command, parameter and item class. Inspection
exposes these quantities under `benchServiceCosts`. A total action-price
override retains precedence. Results and CSV exports identify supplied resource
overrides and applied action overrides separately.

Fossil comparison shows captured quotes, chance intervals and costs with real
currency artwork. Fully priced subsets with observed successes rank first by
cost per success; remaining subsets rank by sampled chance. Other sort modes
and CSV export are available. Selecting a subset only configures the workbench.

## Assumptions

- Rare affix counts use 4/5/6 with weights 8/3/1; magic counts use one/two equally. Eldritch Chaos uses two/three on the affected side equally.
- Independent vectors advance across modifier lines; scalar and legacy singleton rolls apply uniformly. Raw single-stat precision is used when it maps unambiguously to one displayed range. Other ranges use inclusive displayed integers or illustrative fractional rolls. Hidden stat correlations may be missing.
- [Craft of Exile's metamod reference](https://www.craftofexile.com/metamods) informs action-specific protection. Undocumented game changes can lag detection.
- Conflict uses the [empirical tier-difference model](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/13y05ag/orb_of_conflict_rates_50_11n_to_upgrade_per_n/).
- Recombination uses [community count measurements](https://github.com/Maliffic/Resimbulator/blob/master/docs/guide.txt), normalizing rounded rows. Eligible entries are chosen uniformly; hidden weights remain uncertain.
- [3.26 follow-up measurements](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1ldc3lz/326_recomb_psas_a_few_useful_tipsconfirmations/) supersede the old exclusive-mod filler behavior. Exclusive entries contribute at most one count per side; unresolved exclusive-only ordering is rejected.
- Predictable mode requires the in-game percentage for the exact inputs and selections. It fits a shared class constant using the community transfer formula, tier-cumulative pool weights and per-base caps. This supports conditional recipe simulation; it is not an independent prediction of the displayed percentage. Base shares remain model-dependent. The [original formula research](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1jzu2py/poe_2_patch_020_guide_to_recombinators_part_1/) began in PoE 2; PoE 2 class constants are not substituted into PoE 1.
- Memory mechanics use the [3.29 measurements and published data](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1wr9445/329_everything_you_need_to_know_about_memory/) and [subsequent statistical analysis](https://github.com/Rasslabsya4el/crafting-system/blob/main/docs/research/2026-11-01-strand-sheet-fit.md). Retained tiers are weighted by total/retained tier count. Remembrance samples the 2,255 recorded outcomes rather than assuming a uniform distribution. The shifted Exalted consumption table and Foulborn behavior without strands remain estimates.
- Allflame follows [GGG's explanation of Intangibility](https://outputlag.com/feature/diving-deep-into-path-of-exile-curse-of-the-allflame-with-grinding-gear-games/): the whole craft can fail to create additional outcomes, and successful multiple-outcome crafts build Intangibility. Automatic profiles come from the [3.29.3c client-table export](https://github.com/LocalExile/LocalExile/tree/9a435a565d5b2e180714724e38e0161d0c39842a/sql). The catalog contains 293 upgrade rows for 160 currencies and 45 eligible classes. Cost scaling combines the currency base cost, class multiplier and item-level adjustment, rounding upward; this interpretation still needs independent in-game verification. Gain intervals are sampled uniformly per ghost; hidden distributions remain unverified. Sulphur is charged once per craft, including collapsed crafts. Explicit fixed-index recipes fall back to the only outcome after collapse.
- Socket colours use [Siveran CC0 formulas](https://github.com/Siveran/siveran.github.io/blob/master/src/Main.ts). Tainted branches assume equal positive/negative chances. Added sockets follow the white-socket rule in [3.29 notes](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3985332).
- Omen of Connections fully links existing ordinary sockets, retaining their colours and count. The action consumes one Omen and one Orb of Fusing, following the pinned client item description. Socket bench and Omen of Connections calculations return their single deterministic outcome, including item-property goals. Ordinary random Fusing/Jeweller odds remain outside current coverage.
- Omen of Trichromatism consumes one Omen and one Chromatic Orb to guarantee at least one red, green and blue socket, following the [3.29 patch notes](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3985332) and pinned client description. It preserves socket count and links. Forced positions are sampled uniformly; additional socket colours use the existing model. Those placement and extra-colour probabilities are assumptions, rather than published server weights. Three-socket calculations enumerate six placements under the uniform-position assumption; larger items use labelled sampling. Other socket Omens remain outside current coverage.
- Wilson intervals measure sampling uncertainty, not uncertainty in rules or data.
- Ordinary Annulment odds enumerate the simulator's uniform lock selections and removable modifiers, including fractures and full or partial prefix/suffix locks. This does not establish hidden server weights. Cases where a modeled lock selection leaves no removable modifier fall back to transition-error handling.
- Caster-blocking wand implicits restrict modifier draws and protect matching modifiers during bench rerolls. The model treats ordinary Annulment as ignoring this protection, consistent with its 3.30 treatment of crafted roll blockers. Replacing the implicit removes the restriction.
- Partial-lock Harvest choices include a tag if at least one modeled protection selection leaves a legal tagged modifier and, for augment, a removable original modifier. Other selections or subsequent rolls can still fail. The simulator reports those attempts as transition errors; it does not charge a modeled ingredient cost for a failed transition.

- Retained successes are the first requested successful trials, capped at 100, rather than an unbiased sample of all successes. Final property histograms exclude destroyed items; affix frequencies count final states across all trials.

## Patch maintenance

`python tools/crafting_data_status.py` checks the latest detected and exported RePoE versions at one immutable revision. A new client version can appear before its data export is ready; changed source files signal a review, not automatic compatibility. `python tools/update_allflame_data.py` rebuilds the pinned client-derived Allflame catalog in memory and records source hashes. `python tools/update_crafting_data.py` verifies the exported version before rebuilding supplemental data from the pinned commit. If all source hashes match a previous patch, it requires `--allow-identical-export` after review. Updating the patch requires checking modifier identities, mechanics and regression fixtures together.

For a locally generated candidate, `python tools/compare_crafting_export.py path/to/mods.json` reports missing modifier IDs, additional records by domain, and changed fields against the current supplement. It does not import data or establish that the candidate schema or native item data is current.

The cluster-speed family fixture was extracted from client 3.30.0.1.4 using RePoE `509bdf7afe04e926442b20fe71cca01a03e18e7a`, PyPoE `9530adb2ecf26859085c6717166cfcae956bc7b5`, and the filtered schema SHA-256 `bdc8242b6f6057a6b019bd65a96f1092c8ed786d3c99dedb94c1be46cd88fc66`. The candidate `mods.json` SHA-256 is `a6814fdd00755eca4208b2d5bae7877795e5c91a2d0935daa6748b49f26ec0ce`. This verifies that family only, not the rest of the candidate export.

The same candidate shows ten Light Radius and Accuracy modifiers with changed Light Radius ranges, consistent with the [3.30 patch notes](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/4013680). The crafting model uses the 3.30 ranges for new rolls and Divine Orbs, and retains recognized legacy values until rerolled. This is a crafting-specific overlay; the rest of the native item data remains pinned to 3.29 and still needs a complete 3.30 update.

In that candidate, 368 previously nonzero skill or support display stats are zero while their modifiers still carry granted effects. For example, the mine support tiers retain levels 18, 20, 22 and 25 in those effects. One corrupted Life Gain on Hit support modifier has an old display level of 10 and a candidate effect level of 15. The comparison report lists each affected stat and all granted effects for review. The current updater does not import granted effects, so it rejects this representation change until the importer and native modifier text are updated and verified. A matching effect level is evidence of the new representation, not a general rule for mapping every modifier.

Harvest resistance swaps, supported tagged reforges and augments use costs from the same client and extractor versions, using `HarvestCraftOptions.dat64`; the extracted table SHA-256 is `65c690ba4e90dbafb0f3ff5c433e72fd4dc363f5a43880a5a8b201f682ea109d`. To reproduce it, copy `tools/repoe_harvest_costs.py` into the pinned RePoE checkout as `RePoE/parser/modules/harvest_costs.py`, import the pinned filtered schema and run the `harvest_costs` module against the pinned client CDN version. The three ordinary Lifeforce type IDs match all 14 previously pinned Harvest enchantment recipes; the Sacred type matches the previous augment cost. Existing whole-action price overrides still take precedence over ingredient quotes.

`python tools/update_harvest_enchants.py` joins the pinned client Harvest service table to RePoE modifier text and base classes. It records every source hash and includes deterministic quality-enchantment services, rather than assuming random enchantment weights. Imported matching enchantments are recognised; replacement, recipe goals, inventory state and selected recombination hosts retain their identities. For supplied resource prices, use `wild_lifeforce`, `vivid_lifeforce` and `primal_lifeforce`.

[Announced 3.30 changes](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/4013680) are layered over the pinned dataset where documented. GGG's [FAQ](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/4013527) confirms partial locks randomly select protected modifiers; their affix sides follow these [3.30 client records](https://poe-datamine.phelnaxgaming.workers.dev/). The simulator assumes equal weights and conservative modifier-group conflicts pending further verification. Historical Necropolis and Crucible crafting are outside this work's scope.
