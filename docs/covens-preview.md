# Covens of Umbra tree preview

The fork bundles upstream PR #10437's **3.30 Standard and Ruthless passive trees**, plus GGG's pinned **3.30 Atlas preview 2**. **New builds default to 3.30**, and new Atlas plans on those builds use the 150-point preview. Existing builds and saved plans keep their recorded versions, including our earlier passive preview.

## Passive tree

New builds open on **3.30**. To convert an existing build, choose it in **Tree > Version** and review the native conversion dialog. Keep a separate tree spec when you want to compare versions. **3.30 (ruthless)** and the earlier **3.30 preview** remain selectable. The imported upstream parser handles the new distance wording and strips GGG tooltip tags from downloaded mastery descriptions.

The tree warning and AI build analysis identify builds still using the earlier preview. Items, gems and new league mechanics still use the current calculation engine; adding the tree does not establish full 3.30 calculation support. Review unsupported modifiers before relying on a result.

## Atlas

Choose **3.30.0-preview** in Atlas. New Atlas plans on a preview character select that version automatically. The official base point limit is **150**, with granted points accounted for separately. Search, routing, strategy stages, native saving, bundles and MCP proposals preserve the exact preview version.

GGG's Standard and Covens Atlas exports have identical graph data at this pinned revision; the generator checks this and records both source hashes. Ruthless Atlas data is not bundled. Stable **3.29.3** is also available, while 3.29.1 and 3.27.0 remain available for existing plans.

`python tools/update_passive_preview.py` regenerates the passive preview using the existing ascendancy-position preprocessor. `python tools/update_atlas_data.py --version 3.30.0-preview` regenerates the Atlas preview. Both use immutable source commits and bundle artwork for offline use. Provenance and asset SHA-256 hashes are stored beside the generated data.

After changing bundled artwork, run `python tools/update_headless_image_sizes.py` to refresh image dimensions used by headless rendering. The UI suite uses real dimensions and sprite UVs for passive-tree screenshots, including textured connectors and repeated backgrounds.
